# Spotify 2023 Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Spotify 2023 dataset, exploring patterns in popular music across multiple dimensions.

## Overview

The analysis covers five key areas:

1. **üéµ Music Analysis**: Audio features and trends in popular songs
2. **üì± Platform Comparison**: Song popularity across different streaming services  
3. **üë• Artist Impact**: How artist involvement relates to song success
4. **üìÖ Temporal Trends**: Music preferences and characteristics over time
5. **üåê Cross-Platform Presence**: Performance across different streaming platforms

## Dataset

The analysis uses the `spotify-2023.csv` dataset containing information about:
- Track and artist details
- Release information
- Platform presence (Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Shazam)
- Audio features (danceability, energy, valence, etc.)
- Streaming metrics

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the analysis:**
   - Open `spotify_data_analysis.ipynb`
   - Ensure `spotify-2023.csv` is in the same directory
   - Run all cells to see the complete analysis

## Key Findings

**Music Characteristics:**
- Higher danceability and energy correlate with success
- Popular music averages ~128 BPM (typical pop tempo)
- Major keys dominate (~65% of successful songs)

**Platform Insights:**
- Spotify maintains strongest presence across all metrics
- Cross-platform presence is crucial for maximum impact
- Strong correlation between platform performances

**Artist Collaboration:**
- ~40% of popular songs feature multiple artists
- Collaborations are common but don't guarantee higher streams
- Solo tracks vs collaborations show varied success patterns

**Temporal Trends:**
- 2023 releases dominate the dataset
- Certain months show higher success rates
- Audio feature preferences evolve over time
